 Q:Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.

 A:
 1. When it comes to getting the value , we use index in ArrayList, but in LinkedList, we use the pointer of the piror element.
 2. The time complexity of adding or removing elements is O(n) in ArrayList, but it is O(1) in LinkedList.
